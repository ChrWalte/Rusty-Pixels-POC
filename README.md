# Rusty-Pixels-POC

this is just a rust pixels crate proof-of-concept.
a lot of this was taken from the [rust pixels crate examples](https://github.com/parasyte/pixels), but this was done to learn more about rust and the pixels crate for an upcoming project containing the two.

## Running the Proof-of-Concept

to run the Rusty-Pixels-POC rust application, first have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed along with its toolchain (specifically cargo).

next, download this source code by either downloading the zip file or by cloning it locally using [git](https://git-scm.com/).

finally, run the following in a terminal:

```shell
cargo run
```

optionally, to run the Rusty-Pixels-POC application in release mode run the following in the terminal:

```shell
cargo run --release
```
